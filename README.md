# Spatial Analysis Projects for UC Merced
Using ArcGis, data, and provided instructions from the professor I created terrain, topographic maps to name a couple. Using the data we can shade hills, find streams, and even create thermal maps. This class required a lot of time and dedication to get familiar with ArcGis and learn Spatial Analysis, but I was able to learn a number of new things. Here in this repository I have some of my work I created during my time in this class. I have misplaced Lab 2 unfortunately. As for the Final Project, the final product was a report which is why there aren't similar files like the labs.
