# Spatial Analysis Projects for UC Merced
Using ArcGis, data, and provided instructions from the professor I created terrain, topographic maps to name a couple. Using the data we can shade hills, find streams, and even create thermal maps. This class required a lot of time and dedication to get familiar with ArcGis and learn Spatial Analysis, but I was able to learn a number of new things.
